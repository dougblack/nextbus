An Android client for the Georgia Tech Nextbus stop service.

Development has ceased due to lack of time and working Android device. However, it's been installed over 1000 times and has over 500 active users. I'd love it if some other kind soul could take over development to provide the Georgia Tech student body with a beautiful, simple Android Nextbus app.

I hope you decide to fork/pull and help out. Contact me if you have any questions!
